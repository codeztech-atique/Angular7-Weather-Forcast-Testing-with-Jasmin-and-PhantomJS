## Build
- `npm run build:prod` to build a production optimized version of the app.
- `npm run docker:debug` to run tests and build a containerized version of the app.

## _Deprecated: Waffle.io_
Sadly Waffle.io no longer exists. I recommend using GitHub Projects as a free replacement.

## _Deprecated: Using Zeit Now with Docker_
Unfortunately Zeit Now no longer allows publication of arbitrary `Dockerfile` images. Using Zeit v2 you can publish the output of your `dist` folder and still be able to host your application for free.

A replacement for publishing arbitrary Docker images would be a new service called [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/). A sample command would look like `gcloud beta run deploy --image localcast-weather`.

## Developers
### Pre-requisites
- Do NOT install `@angular/cli` or `typescript` globally to avoid version mismatch issues across multiple projects.
- Run `npx @angular/cli new app-name --routing` to create a new Angular app with basic routing wired.
  - If you have trouble with this command, try `npx -p @angular/cli new app-name --routing`
- To run `ng` commands from within the project directory, preprend `npx` to commands, like `npx ng build`.
- To continue using `ng` without having to prepend `npx`, configure shell autofallback as described here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx#shell-auto-fallback.
### During Development
- Run `npm start` for a developmenet server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
### Code scaffolding
- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
### Further help with Angular CLI
> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.
